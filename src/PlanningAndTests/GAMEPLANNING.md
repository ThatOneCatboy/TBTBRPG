This document will outline major milestones and goals in these tasks, as well as minor milestones and general planning, such as pseudocode and code structure comments.

This will not represent the final product, but should provide a rough timeline and estimate for the progress of this section. Bear in mind these notes as you delve into the details of my planning. Enjoy!

## Map Generation
There are three main questions regarding map generation, *what is being generated, how will it be generated,* and *is this optimal*? In this section, I will dive into these questions and hopefully answer them satisfactorily.
### What is being generated?
The map generator will generate an MxN matrix of rooms, where each room has anywhere from 1 to 4 hallways - connections to other rooms - and can be arranged according to seperate rules. These rooms will be created by my girlfriend.
### How will it be generated?

## Game Structure
## Plot, Setting
## Style, Theming
## Main Menu
## Open Source Management
